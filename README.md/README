A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System

TECHNOLOGY:
Artificial Intelligence

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
Handwritten digit recognition is the process to provide the ability to machines to recognize human handwritten digits. 
It is not an easy task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect, vary from person-to-person, and can be made with many different flavors.

THE MNIST DATASET:
Among thousands of datasets available in the market, MNIST is the most popular dataset for enthusiasts of machine learning and deep learning. 
Above 60,000 plus training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and more than 10,000 images for testing are present in the MNIST dataset. 
So, 10 different classes are in the MNIST dataset. The images of handwritten digits are shown as a matrix of 28Ã—28 where every cell consists of a grayscale pixel value.
We have created and deployed a successful deep learning project of digit recognition.When we give a handwritten digit as input image then it will predict the digit and shows the results.
